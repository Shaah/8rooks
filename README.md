# 8Rooks

this project is a POC for 8 Rooks game.


you can always place n Rooks in an Nxn board in a way that they dont crossing each other.

user can add and remove rooks from the board or use a solver.

TODO :
user can compete with AI and place Rooks with different color.
when we have all N Rooks in the chess board, whoever has more pieces wins.
